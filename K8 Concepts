Compressible and Non-Compressible resoruces 
  The resources are categorized as compressible (i.e., can be throttled, such as CPU, or network bandwidth) and incompressible (i.e., cannot be throttled, such as memory).
  In the Application architecture -  we can minimum amount of resources that are needed (called requests) and the maximum amount it can grow up to (the limits).
  In this example we can specific Requets and Limit
